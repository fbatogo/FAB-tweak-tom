# FAB-tweak-tom
A G-code file 'tweaker' for the FABtotum

This app can create a G-code file to be milled on the FABtotum that will allow a piece of sacrificial material to be leveled from the
perspective of the milling head.   It can also tweak existing G-code files to clean up some of the formatting that the FABtotum doesn't
seem to like, and to adjust the feed rates in the X, Y, and Z directions.


PLEASE NOTE : This app is in a *VERY* early stage of development, and may not do anything useful just yet!
